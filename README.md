# CS224N

Random stuff related to CS224N that I'm making public. Not the main repository.

Here are in-development assignments for the 2019 class, which uses Python and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org).

Here are the [videos from 2017](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5Jsnh1rnUwq_TcylNr7EkRe6) and
[the corresponding class website with slides](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/archive/WWW_1617/index.html).

## Homework 1

Homework 1 is an IPython notebook. It doesn't require PyTorch. But you do need a few common Python (NLP) packages (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, gensim, nltk). It relates to material covered in lectures 2 and 3 in the 2017 course.
